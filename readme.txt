Single and multi-level menus for your WordPress site, styled with customizable menu templates.

== Description ==

With Menubar you can easily build and manage single and multi-level menus for your WordPress site.

* Use as menu items the homepage, the frontpage, a category or a category tree, a static page or a page tree, a tag archive or a tag list, a single post, a search box, or any URL, hard-coded or generated from a code snippet (see [1], [2], [3])

* To display a menu, use the *menubar* shortcode or the *Menubar* widget, or insert a simple line of code in your child theme (see [1])

* To style your menus, select one of the default Menubar templates, or your own customized template (see [1])
